<h3>Description of Files</h3>
<p>
I'll maintain a list here of the files in this repository and what they do.

<ul>
<li><strong>parse.py</strong>: A script for taking a text version of a Java HashMap (output from an Apache Mahout MapReduce job) and converting it to a histogram.</li>
<li><strong>sample_arb_dist_with_uniform.py</strong>: This was a venture into sampling arbitrary distributions, given that one's API (cough PHP cough) had only uniform random number generators.</li>
<li><strong>particle.js</strong>: An experiment with HTML5 canvas. You can create a simulation of particles which fly around the canvas with a certain amount of gravity. When a critical mass of particles balls up in a critical radius, they explode. It's pretty neat.</li>
</ul>
